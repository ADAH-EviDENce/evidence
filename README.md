# evidence

`evidence` --  a doc2Vec-based assisted close reading tool with support for abstract concept-based search and context-based search.

## Machine-supported research in humanities
While research in the humanities has been able to leverage the digitization of text corpora and the development of computer based text analysis tools to its benefit, the interface current systems provide the user with is incompatible with the proven method of scholarly close reading of texts which is key in many research scenarios pursuing complex research questions.

What this boils down to, is the fact that it is often restrictive and difficult, if not impossible, to formulate adequate selection criteria, in particular for more complex or abstract concepts, in the framework of a keyword based search which is the standard entry point to digitized text collections.

## Querying by example - close reading with tailored suggestions  
`evidence` provides an alternative, intuitive entry point into collections. Using the doc2vec framework, `evidence` learns abstract representations of the content of the elements of the user's corpus.
Departing from a set of corpus elements that the user selects as relevant starting points, `evidence` retrieves similar elements and presents them to the user, using the users feedback to refine its retrieval.
This enables a user to combine the power of a close-reading approach with that of a large digitized corpus, selecting elements from the entire corpus which are likely to be of interest, but leaving the decision up to the user as to what evidence they deem useful.

## Prerequisites

Verify that your ``docker-compose`` version is at least 1.25.4. (Earlier versions may work).

```shell
docker-compose --version
```

Verify that your ``docker`` version is at least 19.03.12. (Earlier versions may work).

```shell
docker --version
```

## Define which corpus to use

Define the name of the dataset/experiment. Here we choose 'getuigenverhalen'. The corpus files should reside under ``/experiments/<EXPERIMENT>/corpus``, see sample corpora.

```shell
export EXPERIMENT=getuigenverhalen
```

## Building the model generation image

Be aware that building can take a couple of minutes.

```shell
# (starting from the repo root directory)
docker-compose --file generate-model.yml build generate-model
```

## Generating the doc2vec model

```shell
# (starting from the repo root directory)
docker-compose --file generate-model.yml run --user $(id -u):$(id -g) generate-model
```

## Build the user interface web application and start it

```shell
# (starting from the repo root directory)
export EXPERIMENT=getuigenverhalen
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

Frontend should now be usable at [``http://localhost:8080``](http://localhost:8080).

> We strongly suggest not making the frontend available publicly as there is no authentication. Anyone with the url will have access to the frontend.
Running it on a local network, for example a university network, should be protected from most evil-doers.

## Optional: manage frontend users

The first page of the frontend forces you to select a user or 'gebruiker' in Dutch.
A user called `demo` exists and can be selected.

### Change initial user

The initial user named ``demo`` can be renamed by setting the `FRONTEND_USER` environment variable before running `docker-compose up`.

For example to have `myinitialusername` as a user name, do the following:

```shell
# (starting from the repo root directory)
export EXPERIMENT=getuigenverhalen
export FRONTEND_USER=myinitialusername
docker-compose up
```

### Add additional users

If the existing user is not enough, you can add a new user to the frontend with the following command
(you can choose your own username by replacing `mynewusername` value in the command below):

```shell
export EXPERIMENT=getuigenverhalen
export FRONTEND_USER=mynewusername
docker-compose run usercreator
```

To add more users, repeat the command with different values for `FRONTEND_USER`.
